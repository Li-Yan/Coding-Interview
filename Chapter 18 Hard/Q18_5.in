The
overarching
goal
when
writing
code
is
to
make
it
easy
to
read
and
to
understand
Well
written
programs
are
easier
to
debug
easier
to
maintain
and
have
fewer
errors
Writing
a
program
is
alot
like
writing
an
essay
When
writing
an
essay
your
message
is
more
convincing
when
it
is
accompanied
by
proper
grammar
and
punctuation
When
writing
computer
programs
you
should
follow
the
same
principle
It
is
even
more
important
when
programming
since
someone
may
be
assigned
to
maintain
and
support
your
code
for
long
periods
of
time
You
will
appreciate
the
importance
of
good
style
when
it
is
your
task
to
understand
and
maintain
someone
else
code
